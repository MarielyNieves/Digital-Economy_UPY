TECHNOLOGIES AND THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL ECONOMY
During the last years Industry 4.0 has been advancing mainly to benefit the digital economy, within this industry you can find different technologies applied for the development of the global economy, however the technology that stands out the most is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is the cause of promoting all companies to initiate a digital transformation within their work processes. AI is cataloged as the way in which computer systems can solve problems that normally the human mind can not, the way to solve these problems is through the implementation of two processes focused on Machine Learning and Deep Learning , although it seems that the two are relatively related, they are quite different in the way they are applied, since the first focuses on the development of certain techniques for algorithms to learn and improve over time, becoming in recent years as the most used branch in commerce for the simple fact that this technique can process large amounts of data (Big Data) and identify different patterns of behavior, and achieve that people can know the behaviors in any aspect whether sales, illnesses, relationships, among other things and thus be able to make the right decisions and benefits for the economy, on the other hand the second branch,  the DL is a sub-branch of ML, this is a set of algorithms or neural networks that are related to the automatic learning only machines, this is used more to obtain the context of any information from any device such as a car, sensors or any object while making the machines through programming to work having a human-like intelligence, in this way it is achieved that within any company there are certain advantages such as the automation of processes (machines can develop routine tasks by themselves), the power in creative tasks (people tend to have more time to develop their functions in a faster and more creative way within the company), the contribution of accuracy and the reduction of human error (AI provides people with better decisions compared to manual decision making and prevents some industry failures that people normally do not provide), reduces the time of data analysis (this is done through Cloud Computing which allows certain operations and data subtraction to be done in real time) and finally improves decision making economically since by obtaining more information in a structured way, it allows to have a more focused vision on the objective and the consequences which makes decision making faster and more efficient, taking this into account, It should also be mentioned that thanks to Artificial Intelligence in the year 2021 have obtained certain trends of use within certain companies or businesses such as the Inclusion of the multi-cloud which is the transfer of all data to a cloud, in order to adjust to future needs, as well as the use of virtual reality and increases to improve the customer service experience, chatboots which are quick responses of conversations between an intelligent machine and a customer in order to have a faster customer service, and the last trend considered the most important would be the massive use of blockchain which aims to prevent any loss of information and future fraud within the company and its customers. Then, as mentioned above one of the main causes for AI to work is to implement ML which is considered as the use of algorithms that receive data, analyze it, and predict output data, so the more data is introduced the algorithms learn to have an optimization in their performance and making companies take it as important information for decision making.  ML is divided into three distinct types of learning, the first is supervised learning which aims to identify patterns in the data through observations until it achieves a high level of accuracy, some examples would be the Regression Algorithms (It is an algorithm focused on a dependent variable and independent variables of numerical value), another widely used algorithm would be the Bayesian which are based on Bayes theorem (It is an algorithm that has an independent variable and a dependent variable, so that through the probability of these, you can predict certain characteristics of the data set), the last one algorithm related to the SL would be the decision trees which work with binary variables ie 1 and 0, and have a similar structure to the flowchart.  The second learning would be the non-supervised, which unlike Supervised, this only seeks that the data become more organized without the need to have a label or dependent variable, within this category are known clustering algorithms that serve to create groups with similar characteristics between them but different between each group, another related algorithm would be the reduction of variables which is used more regularly, although these two types of learning have different approaches many times they work together and finally the third type of learning is by reinforcement which is a trial and error work, some algorithms learn from past experiences such as neural networks. Some examples of applications of ML algorithms, would be the detection of fraud commonly used in banks especially the analysis of credit card management, prediction of errors within a company causing decisions to be more efficient to achieve because they can have clear objectives and thus avoid errors, medical diagnoses such as diseases or future predictions of any disease geographically as in the case of COVID-19, market demand forecasting and customization of content based on the user, these two applications are used more in the area of Tourism and Sales, image analysis this serves to identify the characteristics of an object or a person if it is necessary to search for it or make an examination of body features, among others. Similarly the impact they have had within companies to improve their economy would be that there is an automation of processes, as these have become more agile and less tedious to perform and tend to have more effectiveness in the same way you could find the cost reduction because thanks to the predictions companies can field the most demanded products and services for sale and purchase, Finally the biggest advantage is that companies have shown that by implementing ML customer satisfaction has risen because they can have a customer service during 24 hrs (Chatboots), for this reason it is considered a competitive advantage because it achieves better performance and production continuously. But can all these technologies really be applied without data? The fundamental answer is NO, currently it is known that thanks to the data that companies provide, all these algorithms have been able to work correctly, which is why Big Data is the main friend of AI and ML. Big data as it refers is the huge amount of data accumulated within a space, usually consists of four important dimensions such as Volume focused on the management of data that occur daily in organizations and companies, Variety which focuses on a variety of digital information such as audio, text or images, Speed, this dimension is the ability to store and work in real time with data generators and the last is Veracity which is responsible for analyzing the volume of data to obtain relevant information,  In conclusion, Big Data helps algorithms to study stored information and make certain forecasts in business in real time, for this reason the impact it has had on the non-digital economy is enormous because all companies that apply Big Data with ML, manage to have an advantage over the competition by obtaining more agile responses to any problem, in turn obtain higher profits thanks to the reduction of cost and offering new products and services because with the Big Data Analytics, new products or services have come out satisfying the needs of people in a physical way. So far, we have only talked about the impact that has been had by implementing certain technologies in the non-digital economy, however, this does not mean that there are no impacts in the digital economy on the contrary lately there have been quite a lot, however, all this began thanks to cloud storage which is the faithful ally of Big Data. This term was created in 2006 being the main pioneers the companies Google and Amazon, it was created because the traditional storage systems did not support the volume of data, so they were looking for a tool that could work in a more comfortable way with the data without affecting the companies, for this reason Cloud Computing was created referring to have access to a software with data stored through the web and having the characteristics of self-service in search of information, as well as the way to have access in a fast and limited way through multiple platforms and above all be scalable but flexible to any situation, this allows companies to offer a supervised service, since they can obtain cost reduction and pay-per-use (since only one data storage would be used instead of several), as well as the automation of maintenance tasks in electronic or physical services,  greater access capacity and productivity especially in the production areas by the constant monitoring of workers or in the sales area since in that aspect it would not only be handled physically but also virtually making companies can access new international markets having direct access to consumers as in the case of Amazon, Shein, Airbnb or Netflix and others. So, it is easy to see how Cloud Computing is related to Big Data as these two together make the storage and analysis of data to meet business needs, thus achieving a wide range of resources to generate a stable economy. Also, another discovery that has been made thanks to the use of these technologies especially Cloud Computing, certain companies nowadays use technologies focused on finance, such is the case of the Hyperledger foundation which is considered an organization that is based to obtain resources necessary to make blockchain ecosystems work well with the aim of building business solutions when moving finance, but why this foundation to put the blockchain? Well, the blockchain is a new tool known since 2011 that solves the problems of central banks, making all transactions to be made in a more direct and secure way making there are no intermediaries (banks), and it is only a transaction from person to person, currently there are several companies that have been coupled to this type of system such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, BBVA, etc. Right now, the question that most people ask is how this type of system that has been positioning lately works, well at this point we could focus on digital currencies or also called cryptocurrencies which were created with the principles of cryptography, and offer a safer way to transport money with the blockchain system, and also offer several advantages such as lower inflation, helps to convert capital and especially during the transactions of these are not generated interest as normally done in transactions made by banks or businesses, for all these reasons the blockchain and digital currencies have had a great impact on the digital economy, especially in first world countries such as the United Kingdom or China, in which its citizens and the government have begun to work with this type of decentralized technologies for the improvement of its economy and conservation of its capital, in addition to offering various services such as payments in the real world through a card in which cryptocurrencies can be loaded as if it were conventional money, Similarly, most of companies want to implement security and payment services in the cloud storage as well as in the digital identity providing more security to existing services, as well as the improvement as mentioned above of financial transactions which vary depending on the use you want to give, it could become a common transaction in everyday life or also be able to become a financial transaction at the enterprise level which covers the payment in exchange for a resource, although normally transactions were made in a physical way today thanks to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, payment methods have been changing little by little, now can also be done through offering currencies or other assets without involving the goods or the capital of the company, currently used in different areas such as commercial, industrial, services and investments making the digital economy faster, intangible, truthful and especially recently used in several places and wanting to implement it in Central and North American countries. At the end, although AI, Big Data Analytics and Blockchain technologies are new resources and employed in an efficient way there are still some technical obstacles and technological challenges, for example the lack of awareness or understanding of the function of the technologies (such as commercial trade) by governments, institutions or individuals, another technical obstacle is the lack of access and skills (many people or workers are not prepared or lack the relevant skills to access the control of the same technologies), another example would be the lack of availability of payment solutions (most people tend to have a tendency of distrust when making payments through bank transfers), another example would be that if any company would apply these types of technologies in a city or country that lacks a good economy it would tend to generate a bad investment since there would not be any profit and if so it would be minimal. Now, focused more on the interior of the companies a major obstacle to the application of technologies will be the destruction of jobs since several jobs such as security guards, messengers, cab drivers or drivers will be replaced by intelligent machines, another case within the company would be in the case of AI in which projects related to this technology take too much time and cost of implementation, finally another technical obstacle that most have had is that there is still no boom in the recruitment of people focused on the digital economy.  Finally, regarding the policy, reference is made to the lack of policies or standards to address any problems related to the digital economy vs. the companies, it could also cause a huge decrease in foreign investment causing problems in the policies of trade agreements as currently several countries are no longer complying with making physical investments, when using the digitization of the economy in various global markets e-commerce, e-health, e-education, digital development industries or software applications, As in the case of the Salvador, which wants to digitize its currency to bitcoin, although the project is being promoted, there are still some inconsistencies and distrust about whether the application would work or have a negative impact in the long or medium term in its political and economic system, Therefore many researchers on the subject say that before any decision before an investment in digital economy it is best to create and implement new regulations that address some issues such as privacy or data protection, so that each of the governments in the future could have a systemic and proactive approach to technology investment and thus not run the risk of having a digital and non-digital economy between countries.
