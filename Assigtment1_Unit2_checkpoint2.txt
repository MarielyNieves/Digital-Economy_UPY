During the last years Industry 4.0 has been advancing mainly to benefit the digital economy, within this industry you can find different technologies applied for the development of the global economy, however the technology that stands out the most is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is the cause of promoting all companies to initiate a digital transformation within their work processes. AI is cataloged as the way in which computer systems can solve problems that normally the human mind can not, the way to solve these problems is through the implementation of two processes focused on Machine Learning and Deep Learning , Although it seems that the two are relatively related, they are quite different in the way they are applied, since the first focuses on the development of certain techniques for algorithms to learn and improve over time, becoming in recent years as the most used branch in commerce for the simple fact that this technique can process large amounts of data (Big Data) and identify different patterns of behavior, and achieve that people can know the behaviors in any aspect whether sales, illnesses, relationships, among other things and thus be able to make the right decisions and benefits for the economy, on the other hand the second branch, ie the DL is a sub-branch of ML, This is a set of algorithms or neural networks that are related to the automatic learning only machines, this is used more to obtain the context of any information from any device such as a car, sensors or any object while making the machines through programming to work having a human-like intelligence, in this way it is achieved that within any company there are certain advantages such as the automation of processes (machines can develop routine tasks by themselves), the power in creative tasks (people tend to have more time to develop their functions in a faster and more creative way within the company), the contribution of accuracy and the reduction of human error (AI provides people with better decisions compared to manual decision making and prevents some industry failures that people normally do not provide), reduces the time of data analysis (this is done through Cloud Computing which allows certain operations and data subtraction to be done in real time) and finally improves decision making economically since by obtaining more information in a structured way, it allows to have a more focused vision on the objective and the consequences which makes decision making faster and more efficient, taking this into account, It should also be mentioned that thanks to Artificial Intelligence in the year 2021 have obtained certain trends of use within certain companies or businesses such as the Inclusion of the multi-cloud which is the transfer of all data to a cloud, in order to adjust to future needs, as well as the use of virtual reality and increases to improve the customer service experience, chatboots which are quick responses of conversations between an intelligent machine and a customer in order to have a faster customer service, and the last trend considered the most important would be the massive use of blockchain which aims to prevent any loss of information and future fraud within the company and its customers. Then, as mentioned above one of the main causes for AI to work is to implement ML which is considered as the use of algorithms that receive data, analyze it and predict output data, so the more data is introduced the algorithms learn to have an optimization in their performance and making companies take it as important information for decision making.  ML is divided into three distinct types of learning, the first is supervised learning which aims to identify patterns in the data through observations until it achieves a high level of accuracy, some examples would be the Regression Algorithms (It is an algorithm focused on a dependent variable and independent variables of numerical value), Another widely used algorithm would be the Bayesian which are based on Bayes theorem (It is an algorithm that has an independent variable and a dependent variable, so that through the probability of these, you can predict certain characteristics of the data set), finally another algorithm related to the AS would be the decision trees which work with binary variables ie 1 and 0, and have a similar structure to the flowchart.  The second learning would be the non-supervised, which unlike Supervised, this only seeks that the data become more organized without the need to have a label or dependent variable, within this category are known clustering algorithms that serve to create groups with similar characteristics between them but different between each group, another related algorithm would be the reduction of variables which is used more regularly, Although these two types of learning have different approaches many times they work together and finally the third type of learning is by reinforcement which is a trial and error work, i.e. the algorithms learn from past experiences such as neural networks. Some examples of applications of ML algorithms, would be the detection of fraud commonly used in banks especially the analysis of credit card management, prediction of errors within a company causing decisions to be more efficient to achieve because they can have clear objectives and thus avoid errors, medical diagnoses such as diseases or future predictions of any disease geographically as in the case of COVID-19, market demand forecasting and customization of content based on the user, these two applications are used more in the area of Tourism and Sales, image analysis this serves to identify the characteristics of an object or a person if it is necessary to search for it or make an examination of body features, among others. Similarly the impact they have had within companies to improve their economy would be that there is an automation of processes, as these have become more agile and less tedious to perform and tend to have more effectiveness in the same way you could find the cost reduction because thanks to the predictions companies can field the most demanded products and services for sale and purchase, Finally the biggest advantage is that companies have shown that by implementing ML customer satisfaction has risen because they can have a customer service during 24 hrs (Chatboots), for this reason it is considered a competitive advantage because it achieves better performance and production continuously.
