##  Technology, ICT, Security and regulations ## 

The society in which we live has been changing thanks to the fourth wave, an example of this would be the public acceptance that has had the branch of technology over the years, which has been the most radical continuous change that humans have witnessed, that is if we remember the past generations the acceptance that was had on technology was very little because not all people used it or understood it and in some countries it was null, However, with the passing of the years and the advance in the way we communicate, the use of social networks, the internet, the use of technological devices, or simply search or share information, we can see that technology has taken an immediate leadership in the various aspects in which a society is governed, this cause has caused the change regarding studies, behaviors, communications of people, for this reason it is said that at present (2021), technology and human life are one and the same that is to say that technology is indispensable for us, this is because we employ, produce and use more technological advances in order to facilitate our lives by meeting our needs as a society, some needs are to improve the economy which is associated with the search for an international market, new sales routes or implementation of machinery to do the job faster and have less costs, another area of need is education in which new ways of teaching, studying or taking some courses on any subject through virtual way has been sought, while both in industry and agriculture or politics in which the improvement of technology is always sought to have more tools of international scope and thus have more territorial power and finally another factor or need that we as humans constantly have are interpersonal relationships, which are related to the constant use of social networks along with ICTs, which thanks to the creation of Facebook and the continuous use and during the last 6 years have been a great success, generating new social and communication habits,  since they not only serve to socialize with people from everywhere, but also serve as a means of marketing for different companies or entrepreneurship, for the study of foreign languages or transmission of information that could not be displayed on the Television, ie social networks could be considered an open book for the general public, as it is known there are different types of social networks such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or the most recent Tik Tok which meet different objectives and functionalities but share that people can use it and transmit information, for this reason we must be very careful how we use them to avoid committing a failure, some recommendations for the good use of the networks are not to reveal personal information, economic information, real time locations, among others because although most people use it to entertain, other people use them to do wrong things, finally it could be considered that technology, the use of social networks and new technologies have been changing our society along with the economy and the way we work. That is, since the public acceptance about the digital transformation has excelled in a potential way, the use of ICT has changed the way companies or people perform, an example of this would be the structure of the labor market in which there are certain skills required to be a competent person at work, these skills could be divided into two parts, the first part would be skills related to communication for example knowing how to configure and manage the email of a company so that it can have internal communication among its employees or external with its customers, online research about the market in which the company is related making it know about its competences, another important skill would be the management of social networks which are related more to the marketing of the company where the most used social networks are Facebook. LinkedIn, Pinterest. Instagram or Reddit and finally the last skill would be to have the knowledge of how to make a publication of documents in online conferences in which it is required to have certain knowledge for example knowing how to use tools such as Skypy, Zoom, Google or Oficce Microsoft for the purpose of transmitting certain information, now on the technology side the skills required are based on what companies need, however the most required are text preprocessing, relational or non-relational database management from SQL or Cassandra, the use of Hadoop to create clusters where people can connect and share information more easily as well as the use of programming languages to perform certain data analysis, artificial intelligence, Big Data or cybersecurity, likewise it is required to know the use of IoT to create local networks within a company, another skill required recently is e-commerce for buying and selling products an example of companies that require this skill would be Amazon or Shein and finally web programming, in which each skill has the purpose that companies can have employees who have a different view of the business, and creativity to solve problems quickly and maintain a high level of competitiveness, ie the management of Business Intelligences. Now, it could be considered that the digital transformation has not only affected the workplace, it has also affected student life especially with the arrival of COVID-19, education has benefited through ICTs because in this way students despite being isolated could continue taking classes in a comfortable but challenging way because both teachers and students needed to acquire new skills such as knowing how to use the computer, cell phone, study tools like Classroom, Zoom, Meet, Kahoot, making learning is complementarily different used to in 2018, finally the use of ICTs have also affected our daily life in which each person of different age had to adapt or evolve acquiring new skills for example from knowing how to use a computer, television, Social Networks like Whatsapp or Facebook, Apps like Didi, Uber, Rappi, or Bancomer, For this reason it can be concluded that technology, whether it is accepted or not, changes the way we live every so often, so people must always be within reach of them, through the knowledge acquired individually or shared, to have a society prepared for the advancement of technology.
