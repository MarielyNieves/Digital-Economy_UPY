During the last years Industry 4.0 has been advancing mainly to benefit the digital economy, within this industry you can find different technologies applied for the development of the global economy, however the technology that stands out the most is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is the cause of promoting all companies to initiate a digital transformation within their work processes. AI is cataloged as the way in which computer systems can solve problems that normally the human mind can not, the way to solve these problems is through the implementation of two processes focused on Machine Learning and Deep Learning , Although it seems that the two are relatively related, they are quite different in the way they are applied, since the first focuses on the development of certain techniques for algorithms to learn and improve over time, becoming in recent years as the most used branch in commerce for the simple fact that this technique can process large amounts of data (Big Data) and identify different patterns of behavior, and achieve that people can know the behaviors in any aspect whether sales, illnesses, relationships, among other things and thus be able to make the right decisions and benefits for the economy, on the other hand the second branch, ie the DL is a sub-branch of ML, This is a set of algorithms or neural networks that are related to the automatic learning only machines, this is used more to obtain the context of any information from any device such as a car, sensors or any object while making the machines through programming to work having a human-like intelligence, in this way it is achieved that within any company there are certain advantages such as the automation of processes (machines can develop routine tasks by themselves), the power in creative tasks (people tend to have more time to develop their functions in a faster and more creative way within the company), the contribution of accuracy and the reduction of human error (AI provides people with better decisions compared to manual decision making and prevents some industry failures that people normally do not provide), reduces the time of data analysis (this is done through Cloud Computing which allows certain operations and data subtraction to be done in real time) and finally improves decision making economically since by obtaining more information in a structured way, it allows to have a more focused vision on the objective and the consequences which makes decision making faster and more efficient, taking this into account, It should also be mentioned that thanks to Artificial Intelligence in the year 2021 have obtained certain trends of use within certain companies or businesses such as the Inclusion of the multi-cloud which is the transfer of all data to a cloud, in order to adjust to future needs, as well as the use of virtual reality and increases to improve the customer service experience, chatboots which are quick responses of conversations between an intelligent machine and a customer in order to have a faster customer service, and the last trend considered the most important would be the massive use of blockchain which aims to prevent any loss of information and future fraud within the company and its customers.
